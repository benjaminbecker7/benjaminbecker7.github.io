            <h3>A Little Bit About Myself</h3>
            <h4>I Love to Work With Computers</h4>
            <p>
                Ever since I was 5 and I was given my first GameBoy Advance
                with a cartridge of Super Mario Bros. 3, I have been incredibly
                interested in how computers work. Their ability to perform complex
                calculations and make entire worlds on a screen continues to amaze
                and inspire me as a programmer. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My interest in computers was further amplified when I was in
                middle school and purchased a copy of Minecraft. I immediately
                fell in love with the simplicity and modifiability of the game. 
                In high school, I began to use this game to continue to explore
                the world of computer programming, developing mods to change certain
                aspects of the game and creating my own public server on the internet
                from scratch that I used to play with my friends.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was also in high school that I began to take computer science
                courses at my school. Through these courses I learned to develop
                applications in Visual Basic, C++, and Java. In my AP Computer Science
                class that I took in my senior year of high school, I was able to 
                extend my knowledge of Java that I had gained from playing Minecraft 
                to the world of general programming. After learning about the Java 
                Swing API, and a little independent study of the Java API's used to 
                grab HTML content from the internet, I was able to independently write
                an application that made it easier to run sessions of congressional
                debate for my speech and debate team (more on that later). It was also
                in my AP Computer Science class that I learned more about how to
                connect Java applications to SQL databases over a network. And so, for
                my final project for my class, I created a simulated book store application 
                with a Java Swing front-end and an SQL back-end that could process 
                logins, account creations, and transactions over a network. Needless to say,
                all of these experiences came together to earn me a 5 on the AP Computer 
                Science exam, and an A in the class.
            </p>

            <h4>I Love to Study American Politics</h4>
            <p>
                I grew up in a very political family: my grandfather was the chairman
                of the local Democratic party and ran for Senate a couple times, and 
                half of the people in my family were lawyers. Thus, many of my family's 
                dinner table conversations would end up being about politics, whether it
                was about what President Bush was doing in the White House or how great
                it was that President Obama was in charge or how horrible and unbelievable 
                it was that President Trump got elected into office.
            </p>
            <p>
                But, my own personal interest in American politics did not start to truly
                foment until I started high school and joined the speech and debate team.
                Perhaps overly confident in my own abilities, I chose to compete in what many
                would consider to be the most complex form of speech and debate: congressional 
                debate. If you do not know what that is, the competitors essentially participate
                in a sort of mock congress: students can submit bills for the chamber to debate, 
                there are elections for a person who leads the "sessions" (called the presiding
                officer), and there is a set of esoteric rules and procedures that the contestants 
                must follow throughout the competition. The competitors go back and forth advocating
                either for or against a bill, while the judges rank the competitors based on
                how well they think the competitors would fit into the actual United States
                Congress. When I started, I had no clue what I was doing. I had no clue how
                to form cogent arguments, I did not understand how parliamentary procedure 
                works, and the legislative process was a mystery to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nevertheless, I persisted. I networked with many bright and eloquent debaters
                to gain a group of people who would vote the way I wanted, I read and memorized
                books on parliamentary procedure, and I studied debate theory and American politics
                until I could essentially eat, sleep, and breathe congressional debate. In doing 
                so, I became a powerful player on the national congressional debate stage. I 
                started qualifying for National Championship tournaments my sophomore year,
                and by my senior year I was the first person from my school to ever qualify 
                for and compete at the Tournament of Champions in congressional debate. I created 
                a caucus of over 40 other congressional debaters from Pennsylvania that could 
                determine the votes in tournaments across the state, and that caucus still exists
                to this day. And, perhaps most importantly, I gained numerous friendships and
                connections to incredibly smart and politically-minded peers all across the country.
                By doing all of this, I cemented a legacy in high school congressional debate 
                that has continued to exist after my graduation.

            <!-- Maybe include something about the 2016 DNC? -->

            <p>
                This background led me to pursue my degree in political science as soon as 
                I started school at Colgate University. In my freshman year, I ran for and was 
                elected to be one of the 10 senators to represent my class in the school's Student 
                Government Association. As a freshman senator, I served as a co-chair of the 
                Government Affairs Committee, which is tasked with maintaining and updating the 
                bylaws and constitution of the Student Government Association. In this position,
                which is normally reserved for upperclassmen, I pioneered initiatives to
                increase transparency between the Student Government Association and the 
                student body by writing legislation requiring the Director of Communications
                of the Association to provide monthly updates to the student body on the activities 
                of the Student Government Association. The next year, I was elected as the Speaker
                of the Senate, where I was able to use my knowledge of parliamentary procedure
                to efficiently run Senate meetings. Finally, as a senior, I was elected to be
                the Vice President of Communications for the Student Government Associations,
                and in that position I was able to continue to pursue my transparency initiatives.

            <h4>I Love Being Able to Combine My Love of Computer Science with My Love of American Politics</h4>
            <p>
                The first opportunity I had to apply my skills in computer science to political
                research was when I participated Colgate's Washington, DC Study Group my 
                sophomore year. Part of the program involved working in a part of American
                politics. So, I joined the Center for Political Accountability as a research
                intern. As a research intern, I was tasked with figuring out how to use the data on
                donations to political organizations over the past 10 years to show the distribution of donors among
                publicly-traded companies, privately-owned companies, individuals, PACs, trade 
                associations, and other organizations. At first we did not know how we were going 
                to do that, but then I came up with an idea to create unique category codes that 
                we could list next to each donation record in the datasets and then aggregate the 
                money in each category and display the numbers in pie charts. By doing this, we 
                could get a solid picture of which groups were donating more to these organizations 
                over the past 10 years.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also came across the issue of how to go through the research as quickly as possible 
                while maintaining the integrity of the data. Keep in mind, we were going through hundreds
                of thousands of donation records and there were only three working interns at the time. 
                So, using my knowledge of Visual Basic from my high school computer science courses, I coded 
                macros in Microsoft Excel that allowed for us to transfer our categorizations among our 
                spreadsheets. This made it so that we could reduce redundant work in our datasets, and 
                cut a job that was supposed to take many months down to just three months. I later went 
                on to port this program to Python with a command-line user interface and a more robust
                data storage system, but the core of the project was created that semester in DC.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was through this experience that I realized that I did not just want to be a political 
                science, but that I also wanted to be able to continue to hone my coding skills. Thus, 
                my junior year I added a major in computer science to my program. I went on to continue 
                my work at the Center for Political Accountability, and was even promoted as the Center's 
                first ever Werner Brandt Research Fellow. Alas, non-profit work is not the most lucrative 
                of professions, and as I am set to graduate in May I am looking for a job as a software
                developer so that I can continue to develop (pun intended) my skills as a computer programmer 
                and full-stack developer.
